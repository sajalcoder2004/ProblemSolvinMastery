        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2 class="lesson-subtitle">Introduction: The Hidden Power You Didn’t Know You Had</h2>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Imagine this: Two people stand before the same challenge. One panics, complains, and blames the world. The other calmly observes, breaks it down, and finds a way through. Who do you think wins in life?
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          The answer is obvious. But here’s the real secret—you can become that second person. The only difference is a skill that most people ignore: <strong>problem-solving</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          In a world that is changing faster than ever, those who master problem-solving don’t just survive—they thrive. They turn obstacles into opportunities, chaos into clarity, and struggles into success.
        </p>
    
        <!-- The Age of Complexity -->
        <h2 class="lesson-subtitle">The Age of Complexity: Why the World is Tougher Than Before</h2>
        <p class="lesson-text">Our ancestors had problems, no doubt. But their problems were simpler:</p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>Find food.</li>
          <li>Survive winter.</li>
          <li>Avoid getting eaten by a lion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Straightforward, right?  
          Now look at us. We face <strong>information overload, career instability, financial pressures, mental health struggles, and rapid technological changes</strong>—all at once! The problems are more complex, but here’s the truth: complex problems demand smart thinkers, not complainers.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text"><strong>The good news?</strong> You can train your brain to be one of those smart thinkers.</p>

          Some people fear that AI will take over their jobs, their decisions, even their lives. But let’s set the record straight—AI is powerful, but it lacks something priceless: <strong>human problem-solving ability</strong>.

        </p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>React emotionally and let the problem control you.</li>
          <li>Analyze logically and take control of the problem.</li>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Let me tell you a quick story.  
          In 1940, a young scientist named <strong>Richard Feynman</strong> worked on the atomic bomb. His job? Solve impossible problems.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          But while others got stuck in complex equations, Feynman used a trick—he broke every problem into the simplest possible form. He treated big challenges like a game of puzzles, solving them piece by piece.

          Most people hear the phrase "problem-solving" and think of math equations, corporate strategies, or some complicated theory.

          But let’s get real.
        </p>

        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>Every time you figure out how to pay your bills on a tight budget, you’re problem-solving.</li>
          <li>Every time you deal with a difficult person, you’re problem-solving.</li>
          <li>Every time you decide whether to quit your job or stay, you’re problem-solving.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Yet, most people never learn how to do it properly. Instead, they panic, overthink, or avoid the problem entirely. Not you. Not anymore.

        <p class="lesson-text">No. Problem-solving is a skill, not a talent. Just like driving, cooking, or working out, you get better with practice.</p>
    
        <p class="lesson-text"><strong>Myth #2:</strong> "Problem-solving means finding the perfect solution."</p>
        <p class="lesson-text">Wrong. In real life, there’s no perfect solution. There’s only the best possible action based on the information you have.</p>

        <h2 class="lesson-subtitle">Introduction: Why Big Problems Feel Overwhelming</h2>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Let’s be honest—when you’re faced with a big problem, it’s easy to feel stuck.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          Your mind starts racing:
        </p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>"Where do I even start?"</li>
          <li>"This is too much!"</li>
          <li>"I don’t think I can handle this."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          This mental paralysis happens because your brain sees the whole problem at once, making it feel impossible. But here’s the secret:
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text"><strong>Big problems don’t get solved all at once—they get solved in small, manageable steps.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="lesson-subtitle">The "Divide and Conquer" Approach</h2>
        <p class="lesson-text">
          If I gave you a 1,000-piece puzzle, would you try to solve it all at once? No! You’d separate the pieces, find the corners, and build from there.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson-text">Problems work the same way. The trick is to divide them into smaller parts and handle one piece at a time.</p>

        <p class="lesson-text">
          Most people look at problems too narrowly. They only see what’s in front of them. But great problem-solvers observe deeply and connect the dots.

    <p class="lesson-text">
      Have you ever met someone who never seems shaken by problems?
    </p>
    <ul class="lesson-list">
      <li>Their business fails? They start another.</li>
      <li>They lose their job? They find a new opportunity.</li>
      <li>A crisis happens? They stay calm and figure it out.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lesson-text"><strong>These people aren’t special. They’ve just trained their minds to see problems differently.</strong></p>

    <!-- The 3 Core Beliefs -->
    <h2 class="lesson-subtitle">The 3 Core Beliefs of a Master Problem-Solver</h2>

    <h3 class="lesson-subtitle">1. Every Problem Has a Solution</h3>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      The moment you believe there’s no solution, your brain stops looking for one.
    </p>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      Instead, train yourself to think: <strong>“There’s always a way—I just need to find it.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      ✅ Example: Thomas Edison failed 1,000 times before inventing the lightbulb. Instead of giving up, he said, "I found 1,000 ways that don’t work."
    </p>

    <h3 class="lesson-subtitle">2. Problems Are Challenges, Not Burdens</h3>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      Weak minds complain about problems. Strong minds embrace them as opportunities.
    </p>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      ✅ Example: When COVID-19 hit, businesses that adapted to online models thrived. Those that didn’t, collapsed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="lesson-subtitle">3. Taking Action is More Important Than Overthinking</h3>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      Overthinking kills more dreams than failure ever will.
    </p>
    <p class="lesson-text">
      ✅ Example: Elon Musk launched SpaceX without knowing if rockets could be reusable. He didn’t wait—he tested, failed, and improved. Now, SpaceX is leading space exploration.
